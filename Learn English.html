  											<h4 id="qat">Question And Answer Tags</h4>
  						 		<p><b>There are some statement that need to be confirmed.These statement are known as QUESTION TAGS,and the answers use for the confirmation are known as ANSWER TAGS.</b></p>
  		<p>The following are the principles that guide Question and Answer Tags.</p>					
  		<p><em>I.A negative statement requires a positive question tag.</em><br>
  			Example:<br>
  		You <u>don't </u>like playing football;<u>Do you?</u><br>
  			The <b>answer tag </b> can be <b>Yes</b> or <b>No</b> depending on the situation.For the statement above the answer can be:<br>Yes,i do (if he like playing football), or <br> No,i don't.(if he dosen't like playing football)
  		</p>
  		 		<p><em>II.A positive statement requires a negative question tag</em><br>
  		 			Example:<br>
  		 			You enjoy listening to music;<u>don't you</u><br>
  		 				The answer tag can be:
  		 				<br>Yes,i do(when the person enjoy listening to music)<br>
  		 					No,i didn't(when the person not enjoy listening to music).
  		 		</p>	
  		 		 		<p><em>III.The tense of the question and answer tag must agree to the tense of the statement.</em>
  		 Example:<br>
  		 We shall go tommorrow.Shall we?<br>
  		 	The question tag follows the statement above.You can see that the tense used for the statement agrees to the tense used for the question tag.They are all simple future tense.It would be wrong if the question tag should have been,<b>'Shouldn't'	we?</b> since <b>'Shouldn't'</b> is the past tense of <b>shall.</b><br>
  		 		Read through the following:<br>
  		 			✔ She will come next week.Won't she?<br>
  		 				✔ They must not go now.Must they?<br>
  		 				✔ You were there yesterday.Were't you?<br>
  		 					✔ The boy did not come.Did he?
  		 		 		</p>	
  		  		<p><em>IV.Brife answer are normally given to question ending with tags,</em><br>
  		  			Example:<br>
  		  			❇Adetiloye Adeola won the prize for the best African basketballer.Didn't he?<br>
  		  				For this statement above,the answer is <b>Yes.</b>
  		  				So,the answer tag should be read<b>Yes,he did</b>
